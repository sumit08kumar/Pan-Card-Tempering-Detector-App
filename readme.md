# **PAN Card Tampering Detector App**  

ðŸš€ **Real-time PAN Card Tampering Detection Using AI**  

---

## **Overview**  

The **PAN Card Tampering Detector App** is an AI-powered solution designed to detect potential forgery or tampering in PAN card images. This application uses advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms to ensure the authenticity of identity documents. Whether you're an individual, organization, or government agency, this app provides a secure, reliable, and scalable way to validate identity cards with precision.

## **Features**  

- **Real-Time Detection**: Upload images and get results instantly.  
- **Tampering Localization**: Highlights suspected areas on the PAN card using bounding boxes or heatmaps.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Available as a web app, Android app, and iOS app.  
- **OCR Integration**: Extracts and validates text details like PAN number and holder name.  
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypts uploaded data and ensures compliance with privacy standards.  

---

## **System Architecture**  

The application uses a modular architecture for scalability and performance:  

1. **Frontend**:  
   - Web app built with **React**.  
   - Mobile apps developed using **Flutter** for seamless cross-platform compatibility.  

2. **Backend**:  
   - RESTful APIs powered by **Flask/Django**.  
   - Preprocessing and tampering detection using **OpenCV** and **TensorFlow**.  

3. **Database**:  
   - **PostgreSQL** for structured data.  
   - **Amazon S3/Google Cloud Storage** for image storage.  

4. **Cloud Infrastructure**:  
   - Hosted on **AWS** with autoscaling and load balancing for high availability.  

---

## **How It Works**  

1. **Upload**: Users upload a PAN card image through the app.  
2. **Preprocessing**: The app enhances image quality and aligns it for analysis.  
3. **Tampering Detection**:  
   - **OCR** verifies text integrity (e.g., name, PAN number).  
   - **Image Analysis** flags pixel-level anomalies or structural inconsistencies.  
4. **Result**: The system provides a tampering score, highlights suspicious areas, and validates authenticity.
